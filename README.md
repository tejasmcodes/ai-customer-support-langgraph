# 🤖 AI-Powered Customer Support Automation System using LangGraph

> IBM Agentic AI Certification Assignment

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements an **AI-Powered Customer Support Automation System** using **LangGraph**. It automates customer support by classifying customer queries, routing them to specialized support agents, retrieving relevant information from a local knowledge base (RAG), maintaining conversation history using SQLite, and handling high-risk requests through a Human-in-the-Loop approval workflow.

The project demonstrates the concepts of **Agentic AI**, **workflow orchestration**, **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**, **persistent memory**, and **supervisory approval**.

# ⚙️ Technologies Used

| Technology       | Purpose                |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| Python           | Backend Development    |
| LangGraph        | Workflow Orchestration |
| LangChain        | LLM Integration        |
| Ollama           | Local LLM Runtime      |

| Local Text Files | Knowledge Base (RAG)   |

---

# 🔄 Workflow

1. Customer submits a query.
2. Intent Classifier identifies the intent.
3. LangGraph routes the request to the appropriate support agent.
4. The selected agent retrieves relevant context from the knowledge base.
5. Ollama (Llama 3.2) generates the response.
6. Billing requests requiring approval are routed to the Supervisor Agent.
7. Customer conversations are stored in SQLite.
8. Memory Agent retrieves previous conversations when requested.
9. Final response is returned to the customer.

---

# 🧠 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

The system implements a lightweight local RAG pipeline.

Knowledge base files:

* `pricing.txt`
* `policy.txt`
* `technical.txt`
* `faq.txt`

Based on the detected intent, the appropriate document is retrieved and supplied as context to the LLM for response generation.

---

# 💾 SQLite Memory

The application stores customer conversations in a SQLite database.

Database:

```text
memory.db
```

Implemented functionality:

* Store customer queries
* Retrieve previous conversation
* Memory-based responses

---

# 👨‍💼 Human-in-the-Loop

Sensitive requests such as:

* Refund
* Subscription Cancellation
* Account Closure
* Compensation

are automatically routed to the **Supervisor Agent** before a final response is returned.

---

# 🤖 Supervisor Agent

The Supervisor Agent reviews and improves responses for sensitive customer requests before approving the final customer-facing response.

---

# 📸 Demonstration Queries

## Sales

```text
What are the pricing plans available for your software?
```

**Expected Route**

```text
Intent Classifier → Sales Agent
```

---

## Account

```text
I forgot my account password.
```

**Expected Route**

```text
Intent Classifier → Account Agent
```

---

## Technical

```text
My application crashes whenever I upload a file.
```

**Expected Route**

```text

```

---

## Billing

```text
